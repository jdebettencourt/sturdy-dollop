
Some gcc examples

Creating files with gcc

...$ gcc program.c

The above compiler command creates the executable file a.out which can then be executed using:

...$ ./a.out

-and-

...$ gcc -o program program.c -Wall -W

The above compiler command creates the executable file program from program.c, showing all warnings; run using a command like:

...$ ./program

-more-
 	
...$ gcc -g -Og -c program.c

The above compiler command produces a basically optimized object file with debug information, `program.o', from the source file `program.c'

...$ gcc -Og -c program.c

The above compiler command produces a basically optimized object file without debug information, `program.o', from the source file `program.c'

...$ gcc -Og -S program.c

The above compiler command produces a basically optimized readable assembler file without debug information, `program.s', from the source file `program.c'
